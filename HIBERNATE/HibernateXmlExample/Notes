1. Create the JAVA Project 
2. Copy the List of JAR's in to lib folder 
3. Add the JARS in to build path
4. place the Hibernate Configuration file i.e "hibernate.cfg.xml" in to */src folder
5. Create the Package to place the Code
	5.1 Place the HBM File here : "Customer.hbm.xml"
6. Crate the Entity class





some time we confused in where we have to write in java and xml and hibernate?


log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.

Hibernate: insert into customers (Name, Email, Phone, City, Bal, Cid) values (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)


100 Line 


Yes Sir, it is working preparedStatement only









"<Entity Class Name > .hbm.xml"

"Customer.hbm.xml"

"Employee.hbm.xml"

"Student.hbm.xml"



XML File name materrs


KEY and VALUE Pair : MAP Collection 

<property name="dialect">org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect</property>

What is dialect property in Hibernate ?
This property is telling Hibernate that which Brand and version of database are you using.
Here by providing "org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect" to hibernate .
I am telling that I am using MySql data base 



 got it.. so if we code now we will have to use this xml that tou showed?
 
 
 
 JDBC 
  We are responsable to create the TABLE 
  
  
How Hibernate is goig to create the Table for you?
Create the Entity Class and map the same class to the Hibernate Using XML 
  
  
     int cid;
		 String name;
		 String email;
	 long phone;
	 String city;
	 double bal;
	
	
		<class name="Customer" table="customers">
		
		<id 
			name="cid" column="Cid" type="int">	
			<generator class="increment" />	
		</id>
				
			<property name="name"  column="Name"/>
			<property name="email" column="Email" />
		<property name="phone" column="Phone" type="long" />
			<property name="city" column="City" type="string" />
		<property name="bal" column="Bal" type="double" />
		
	
	If you are not defining any data type , Hibernate will consider this as a "string" type bydefault

type="string" - optional 
360 type question 


column="Name"
column="Email"
column="Phone"
